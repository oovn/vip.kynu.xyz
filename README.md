## About

Moose Messenger targets to provide a more secure and privacy friendly experience for instant messaging. Thus getting achieved by the use of OMEMO and the ability to connect to Moose servers over ORBOT.<br>
The platform itself is closed and cannot be used with other clients.
<br>
While this speaks against the idea of XMPP, it is necessary to enforce OMEMO on all clients and make the whole thing easier for total beginners, which are interested in using an instant messenger with no data collection.

## Differences to Conversations.im

* OMEMO only (all other options were removed)
* Moose Messenger servers only
* Free to use


## Credits
### All credits to Conversations.im!

Without the effort of Conversations.im this project would have never launched.
All I did was to strip the app and remove unneeded stuff, but besides that it still is their work. Therefore, here the original repo link.
